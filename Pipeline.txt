CI/CD - Continous Integration and Continous Deployement
A CI/CD pipeline automates your software delivery process. The pipeline builds code, runs tests (CI), and safely deploys a new version of the application (CD).
Automated pipelines remove manual errors, provide standardized feedback loops to developers, and enable fast product iterations.
In CICD we will be creating process where build and relaease of a software is fully Automated

With the help of jenkins we wil be ceating a pipeline to automate our current Worklow 
It will be easy for everyone to save our time and it will reduce manula work
Developer will write a source code -commit those codein SC(Git) From git it will go to build where we will compile the code 
Then it will run the test case and it it is succesful then it will go for PRODUCTION


Thankyou
